# Hostel Management System

## Introduction

The Hostel Management System is a Java-based project that automates administrative tasks within a hostel environment. It includes modules for Admission, Hostel details, Visitor management, Complaint management, Mess registration, and Night-out management.

## Purpose

This project aims to streamline hostel operations through efficient data handling using Java and fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). By employing data structures like queues, binary search trees (BST), arrays, and linked lists, it ensures optimized management of admissions, visitor records, complaints, mess registrations, and night-out permissions. Ultimately, it enhances transparency, reduces manual workload, and improves resident satisfaction.

## Features

- **Admission Module**:
  - Manages admission processes using a queue data structure for efficient application handling.

- **Hostel Details**:
  - Stores comprehensive information about hostel facilities, rooms, and occupancy status.

- **Visitor Management**:
  - Tracks and manages visitor details using a linked list for flexible data management.

- **Complaint Management**:
  - Facilitates lodging and resolution of complaints with a prioritization system based on a queue.

- **Mess Registration**:
  - Registers hostel residents for mess facilities using an array for structured data storage.

- **Night-out Management**:
  - Manages permissions and records for night-outs, leveraging a linked list for dynamic tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Java
  
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**:
  - **Queue**: Admission and complaint management.
  - **BST (Binary Search Tree)**: Hostellers' data storage.
  - **Array**: Mess registration.
  - **Linked List**: Visitor management and night-out management.
